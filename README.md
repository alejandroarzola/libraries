# Libraries

Welcome, I've decided to come up with a set of functions I've either
written or bumped into them on the internet.

I'm starting with *JavaScript*, but I'll keep adding stuff on here

## Note
Please note that although some functions are mine, most of them
are of public domain (i.e. *StackOverflow*) answers.

I honestly can't remember where I found them but anyways,
I want to make them available here.
